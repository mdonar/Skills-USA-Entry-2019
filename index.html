            <h1 class="heading">About Us</h1>
            <p>Our road to victory begins, as it always has, with talent. And at Meridia Gaming, Inc., we pride ourselves on not only attracting the best and brightest talent, but also on getting the best out of that talent once they are here. We do this by bringing world-class business processes and rigor to an industry of pure passion. By combining these two seemingly opposing forces, we have been able to achieve both creative excellence and commercial success. The result of this philosophy obviously has great benefit to our employees in that, no matter what project you are working on at Meridia Gaming, Inc., it stands a solid chance of becoming a world-beater that makes a huge impact on popular culture. There are no short straws here. If we're making it, we're putting industry-leading resources, technology, and marketing might behind it. If you asked any employee at Meridia Gaming, Inc. what our core business is, they could justifiably say, "We make blockbusters." Because of our commitment to growing our talent, Meridia Gaming, Inc. is a great place to build a career. We invite you to review our open roles to see if there's a good match. But be warned: our goals are nothing short of making entertainment history.</p>

            <p>Gamers + gaming = fun. Meridia Gaming, Inc. not only makes fun, we know how to have it—a lot of it. Meridia Gaming, Inc. is a community of people who love to have fun together, and our employee camaraderie is fueled by our passion for gameplay. You’re not a gaming company without a place to play. And we not only have a Gaming Zone available for employees to play our games or our competitors games, but we also organize informal tournaments for local bragging rights. Our Gaming Zone is the life-center of our HQ at Meridia, where gaming happy hours frequently occur. Launch parties are also huge bonding events at Meridia Gaming, Inc.. For employees and their families, these events can rival major holidays—and for some of the employee’s children, the parties may even rival birthdays. But our fun doesn’t always come from major celebrations. There is a genuine camaraderie among Meridia Gaming, Inc. employees that has resulted in the creation of grassroots programs led and sustained by employees themselves. We have a Board Game Club, movie nights, and other enthusiast clubs organized around cars, food and sports.</p>
